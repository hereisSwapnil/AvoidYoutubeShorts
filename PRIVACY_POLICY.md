# Privacy Policy for Avoid YT Shorts - Enhanced

**Last Updated**: January 31, 2026

## Introduction
"Avoid YT Shorts - Enhanced" ("we", "us", or "our") is a Chrome extension designed to improve your productivity by blocking YouTube Shorts. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection and usage.

## Data Collection
**We do not collect, store, share, or sell any personal data.**

### Local Data Storage
All data generated by the extension is stored locally on your device using the Chrome Storage API (`chrome.storage.local`). This data includes:
- **Settings**: Your preferences for the extension (e.g., enabled/disabled state).
- **Statistics**: Aggregated counters for the number of Shorts blocked and estimated time saved.
- **UI State**: The position of the on-screen overlay.

This data never leaves your browser and is not transmitted to any external servers.

## Permissions Usage
Our extension requires specific permissions to function correctly:

- **Host Permission (`youtube.com`)**: Required to access YouTube pages to identify and hide Shorts elements. We do not access or modify content on any other websites.
- **Tabs & Navigation**: Used to detect when you navigate to a YouTube Shorts page so blocking can be applied immediately.
- **Storage**: Used solely to save your local preferences and statistics.

## Third-Party Services
This extension operates entirely client-side. We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking scripts, or advertising services.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
